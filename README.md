# 3D Slicer AI Integration Framework

This repository provides a general-purpose framework and tutorial for integrating AI-based medical image models into the [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/) platform. It covers the complete workflow, from Docker packaging and model deployment to UI integration and inference visualization.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Provide a clear and adaptable guide to connect any AI model with 3D Slicer
- Demonstrate how to containerize models and services using Docker
- Enable development and testing via the Slicer Jupyter Kernel
- Design a user-friendly Slicer module UI for streamlined interaction

---

## üìå Architecture Overview

1. **AI Model Code**
   - Supports frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.
   - Includes inference scripts and preprocessing logic

2. **Docker Container**
   - Dockerfile for packaging model and dependencies
   - API interface exposed for Slicer communication

3. **3D Slicer Integration**
   - UI designed with Qt Designer
   - Backend interaction through Jupyter Kernel or RESTful API
   - Displays inference results within Slicer views
