# 3D Slicer AI Integration Framework

This repository provides a general-purpose framework and tutorial for integrating AI-based medical image models into the 3D Slicer platform. It covers the complete workflow, from Docker packaging and model deployment to UI integration and inference visualization.


## üéØ Project Objectives

- Provide a clear and adaptable guide to connect any medical imaging AI model with 3D Slicer
- Demonstrate how to containerize models and services using Docker
- Enable development and testing via the Slicer Jupyter Kernel
- Design a user-friendly Slicer module UI for streamlined interaction
- Provide recommand system structure for image classification task and image detection task

## üìå Architecture Overview

1. **AI Model Code**
   - Supports frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.
   - Includes inference scripts and preprocessing logic

2. **Docker Container**
   - Dockerfile for packaging model and dependencies
   - API interface exposed for Slicer communication

3. **3D Slicer Integration**
   - UI designed with Qt Designer
   - Backend interaction through Jupyter Kernel or RESTful API
   - Displays inference results within Slicer views

## ‚öíÔ∏è Workflow
1. **Download Applications**
  - Download [3D slicer](https://download.slicer.org/)
  - Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

2. **Prepareations**
  -  Have a sturture prototype of your module. It's better to use Powerpoint to design the system stucture.
  -  Please develop a Python script which is used for inferencing. (Please refer to inference.py)
  -  Also, we need a main script to costimize the command. (Please refer to main.py)
  -  Use the command window to test whether the inference.py and main.py is working or not.

3. **Dockerize The Model**
  - Create a project folder as the below
  - Write Dockerfile
  - Build Docker Image `bash docker build -t {your_image_name} . (Don't forget the "." in the end of the command!!!)
  - Activate Docker Container `bash docker run -d {your_image_name}
  - Check in Docker Desktop image and container tab.

4. **Develop the slicer API Using Slicer Jupyter Kernel**
  - Download SlicerJupyter extension in 3D slicer
  - Start Jupyter server in 3D slicer

5. **UI Design in 3D slicer**


## üéñÔ∏è Examples
1. Image Detection: Using YOLOv8 to do lung nodules detection on chest X-ray image.
2. Image Classification: Using Seresnext and LSTM to do muti-class classification.
